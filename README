The code should support methods such as

nm_open()
nm_inject()
nm_dispatch()

nm_open()
	opens a file descriptor e.g. tcp, mmaps one fake tx and rx ring,
	backing store for reads and writes (room for descriptor and packet)

nm_dispatch()
	starts with a non blocking read to extract new info into the ring
	then behaves as the normal one

nm_inject()
	copies into a linear buffer
